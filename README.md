# AN ***EDUCATIONAL*** TARKOV BOT FOR SELLING ITEMS ON THE MARKET
This bot is not a complete nore is it a completely safe version , you can and most likely be banned if used wrong

## HOW TO USE
The bot is made for a 2K resolution screen, it use Junkcases called something containing "sell" in the name.
The bot can be broken if interrupted, it is best to use for full cases that are sort by item size.
1 slot items in a case, 2+ in others. Try to group up items to take advantage of the "auto select fonction"

## HOW IT WORKS
The bot uses pixel colors at precise coordinates to determine which menu it is in. Using computer vision Libaries the bot can find the boxes, scroll through menues select the items.
Once the item is select the bot will take a screen capture of the price, up the saturation and put it in black and white and run it through computer vision to get the price and take of a percentage to assure the price is the lowest
without price guaging.
